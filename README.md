# Guess-the-Number-Game
Guess the Number Gameis a simple Python program where the computer randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it using hints provided by the program.This project demonstrates the use of decision-making statements, loops, and random number generation in Python.It also helps to improve in algorithmic thinking and problem solving.
# Concepts used:
1.Decision making (if,elif,else):These conditions are used to check whether the user's guess is correct,low or high.
2.loops (while): This condition is used to allow repeated guessing until the correct number is guessed.
3.break : this statement is to stop the loop once the correct guess is made.
4.random : This module is to generate a random number between given range.
# Requirements:
Basic knowledge of loops,conditionals and user input in python
# Explanation:
Computer secretly selects a number from given range.Then player will  guess repeatedly until their guess is correct.After each guess, program will provide a hint â€” whether the guess is too high or too low.When the player guesses correctly, program displays the number of attempts and ends.
